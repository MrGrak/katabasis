## Developers: NuGet Packages

NuGet packages are not supported. Please see [BUILDING-FROM-SOURCE.md](BUILDING-FROM-SOURCE.md) instead.

The reason for this is that NuGet packages usually (but not always) only have the compiled source code in binary form and do not have the source code itself. This makes it fundementally anti open-source. If you have a problem you can not easily diagnose and troubleshoot yourself because you do not have the source code. Additionally in such a scenario if you do have a problem and you solve it, then you could submit a pull request if you are so generous.
