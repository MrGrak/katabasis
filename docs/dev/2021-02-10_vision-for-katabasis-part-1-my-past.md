This dev log is part of a multiple part series about the vision for Katabasis.

- Part 1: The vision for Katabasis; My past
- [Part 2: The vision for Katabasis; The present](2021-02-20_vision-for-katabasis-part-2-reflections-architecture.md)

## Intro

To more clearly see my vision for this project I first need to explain how I grew into this position. To do this I need to go over my past from 3 years told to 25 years old with the relative parts related to state of mind and technology. The reason for this is show that multiple problems exist in our society and how gaming, along with Internet culture, has filled in the cracks of these problems. Of these problems, some of which are likely not unique to myself and others among my generation of millenials, especially the tail end in 1993 - 1996. By the end you will start to understand and appreciate Internet culture, gaming culture, programming culture, and "MIT hacker" culture can be seen in a positive manner which is otherwise skewed by mainstream media. 

## My past

### Windows 95, SNES & Nintendo 64

In 1996 to 1998 (age 3 to 5) I was in pre-school. It was in the basement of an elementary school (K-7) called Beairsto in Vernon, British Columbia, Canada. There was a PC with Windows 95. I learned to use the thing pretty quickly with the GUI interface and stumbled upon some games which probably were not intended to be there. There were only a couple games on the computer: Solitare, MineSweeper, SkiFree, Pipe Mania, and Chip's Challenge 2. I started to like Chip's Challenge and played it everyday. When I finished a level I wrote down the code to get to that level along with some chicken scratch words and pictures about what I learned so I could save my progress for the next day. After awhile these notes started to become several pages. One week I got sick and stayed with my grandparents for a day or two while my parents were working. When I returned to the daycare some kids continued my notes and it turned into a small book. I got rather annoyed by the idea that other kids learned how to play "my" game. It did however give me an excuse to start to socializing with the other kids. I didn't really talk to others kids that much and I would keep to myself. Some older kids who were about 4 years older were staying afterschool between 3pm to 5pm which was part of the same daycare. The caretakers let us mingle and the older kids started to like me for my ability to solve complex puzzles on the computer. We would hang out everyday waiting for our parents to come pick us up. The caretakers told my parents about my uncanny ability to solve challenging puzzles and how long I could concentrate doing it.

In 1997 at age 3 and a 1/2 I was in a laundry mat during spring. The household washing machine was in repair and I was dragged along to do their errands downtown on a saturday. I asked if I could have some coins to use the arcade while we waited for the clothings to wash. They said no. I just watched the arcade machine show off gameplay waiting for the laundry. The arcade machine which I was interested was for Super Mario World. My parents toke note of my interest in the arcade machine.

In 1998 for my 5th brithday (August 25th) my parents gave me a choice between a Super Nintendo Entertainment System and a Nintendo 64 at a local pawn shop. I remember my parents arguing that the SNES was cheaper but still gave me the choice. Since there were not that many games in summer of 1998 in NA for the Nintendo 64 and the game I was interested in was Super Mario World, I choose the SNES. I would later regret my descision a bit when my cousins were playing The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time on the Nintendo 64 during the Christmas holidays. 

Since I didn't have any brothers or sisters it become a tradition that I would spend time with my cousins over the holidays. We played video games together in the living room in our pyjamas. Our only interruption was the family dog wanting pets. We played Starfox 64, Banjo-Kazooie, Mario Party, Donkey Kong 64, Super Smash Bros, and Pokemon Stadium. It's during these years between 1999 and 2004 that my cousins and me acquired a taste for gaming *together* even if my older cousins wanted nothing to do with me and my younger cousin. It was the Nintendo 64 sitting on the living room floor that really kindled our friendships. My older cousins started to tolerate me a bit because I could beat them sometimes in Super Smash Bros even though I never played the game before. I posed more of an interesting challenge for them then my younger cousin and they started to see me as a brother.

**Take away: video games can help people connect.**

### Early PC, Game Boy Color & GameCube

In 1999 for Christmas I got a GameBoy Color with Pokemon Blue. During this time I didn't really know how to read some specific words and full sentences or paragraphs on my own without help. However, I was really interested in the game and I *wanted* to know how to read alone. This literally gave me a head start at school in the classroom because of my interest in playing Pokemon. My cousin who is 2 years younger than me even skipped a whole grade at school for similar reason but with Banjo-Tooie for Nintendo 64. Video games helped accelerate our growth and our parents noticed it first hand at home. 

At school I was showing signs of being a prodigy in mathmatics between age 6 and 8. I would ignore the teacher teaching the lesson just start doing the homework. I would finish it in unprecedented time compared to my peers. I wasn't very good at other subjects though due to my lack of empathy at a young age and lack of interest in school in general from being bullied. I didn't tell anyone I was being bullied out of fear, but probably should have in retrospect. The teachers in the public education system didn't know what to do with me during math time. They would give me colouring books which I thought was fine. Problem was that the other kids would get jealous that I got to play while they were forced to practice math. This only made the bulling worse. My parents were lost on what to do with my math skills. There were no programs or extra extracurricular activites at the time in a small town to hone my natural talent. Instead my parents would give me various video games to play by renting them from Blockbuster and buying the ones I liked for my birthday or Christmas. For Christmas in 2000 I got Pokemon Gold. For my 8th birthday in 2001 I got the Gameboy Advance with Golden Sun. For my 9th birthday in 2002 I got the GameCube with Super Mario Sunshine.

In 1999/2000 my parents also had an iMac G3. I would go on to play games such as Nanosaur, Bugdom, Otto Matic, and SimCity 3000. I would also connect to the Internet via dial up (oh god, I still remember the sound) to play Neopets. Neopets was my first exposure to online discussion boards.

In 2002 for Christmas I was 9 years old. I was waking up to faint sound of coffee brewing and starting to slowly realize what day it was. I ran up stairs in my pyjamas in excitement to the Balsam Fir decorated tree with presents underneath. My dad is a forest technician and he would bring in a huge bushy tree every year that was basically a giant house air freshner. There was stockings over the fireplace and more decorations all over the room. My parents stepped out of the kitchen from behind me to greet and hug me. We started to open presents and one of them for me was Animal Crossing for the GameCube. I popped the disc in and Totakeke Slider started to play his guitar. I loved that game so much because for once in my life I had friends, even if they were virtual.

In Janurary 2003 at at age 9 I was at EB Games (Canada's GameStop) in the mall. There was this big advertisement in the store for Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker. I asked my parents for a pre-order. They agreed but they told me it would be an early brithday present and I wouldn't get anything for my birthday as a result. I started playing it on March 24th 2003 on release day. After I beat the game I played Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time the MasterQuest edition that came with the pre-order.

### Game Boy & early PC

When I was over at my cousins for Christmas in 2002 and they had a copy of an English bootleg of RPG Maker 2000 and RPG Maker 2003. RPG Maker 2003 was just released in Japan and my older cousin was playing around with the English bootleg acquired by "some means" of the Internet. This was the first time I heard about getting stuff for free and I found that interesting. After beating Golden Sun, RPG Maker was fascinating to me. I learned that it was possible to create video games and I wanted to explore this area of creativity. For that Christmas my younger cousin also got Final Fantasy: Tactics Advance. I borrowed his Game Boy Advance and started a playthrough while our family was socializing after exchanging gifts. I was a pretty socially akward kid at the time and had no interest being around large group of people. I ran away up stairs away near a window to get good lightning as the Game Boy Advance had no backlight. I grew very fond of the game for it's chess like game play and relatable story as I was getting bullied at school. I stayed over night and later the next day I was playing around with RPG Maker for an hour or two. I thought it would be really cool if I could create even a small part of such awesome games as Golden Sun, Final Fantasy, or Animal Crossing.

**Take away: video games can be a unique form of mass-media.**

### Game Boy Advance SP, GameCube, & mid PC

In 2003 before my birthday my parents devorced. I was 9 years old at the time. As a kid you don't want to believe the devorce is real and you start asking questions. There is always that feeling it was about you even if they say otherwise. I got a Game Boy Advanece SP with Pokemon Ruby and Golden Sun 2: Lost Age for my 10th birthday even though I wasn't suppose to get anything because I got Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker earlier. Soon after they sold the house and started to go there separate ways. I turned bitter and stubborn. Kids at school started to bully me more and I started to develop severe anger problems. Turns out there were issues with money at home. My mom was wilding spending on arts and craft. My dad was spending money wildly on alcohol. During these times, video games became an escape for me from the harsh rocks of reality. Between the nightmare of the devorce between my parents outside of school and the nightmare of being bullied at school, video games were seriously my only friends. Neither of my parents were there for me during these times.

I moved in with my grandparents for a while due to the devorce. They had the time to take care of me because they were retired. I trusted them more than my parents as for once it seemed like I was apart of a normal happy family. My grandma was particularly so nice to me. My grandma would teach me how to bake, garden, and tailor. My grandpa would teach me about mechanics, and how to shoot a BB gun, and skin/gut dead animals. I told them I was being bullied at school. They got a PC before the dotcom bubble burst. They had some games including Full Tilt! Pinball, Sims, and Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2. I would begin to show signs of video game addiction playing Red Alert 2 and the expansion Yuri's Revenge. I really enjoyed the soundtrack from that game and acquired a taste for metal, rock, and electronic music. I remember distinctively opening up the game and watching the opening scene of ["Westwood Studios proudly presents" while Hell March 2 song starting to play](https://youtu.be/fnd0qg4I_MM?t=173). My grandparents would notice that I would be overall less angry after playing the game for a short time. I found that I could use the music combined with the game play to channel and vent my rage. On a saturday during winter I was progressing through multiple levels of the compaign in one seating and my grandparents were arguing. Grandpa: "He's been playing that damn game for over 3 hours; that's not right!". Grandma: "Dear, he's had a hard time lately. Just let the kid be happy for awhile."

I also had somes games for the GameCube like Prince of Persia: Sands of Time, Super Smash Bros: Melee, and Star Fox Adventures.

**Take away: video games can be therapeutic and/or addictive.**

### PC & iPod Mini

In 2004 I moved in with my mom. For my birthday she bought me my first PC with home internet package from FutureShop (now BestBuy) for my birthday. In 2005 when I was with living with my dad for the year he did the same. I was mesmerized by what was bestowed upon me. I started to play various games for longer periods of time. I also could finally explore RPG Maker XP on my own time without going to see my cousins. However, between two parents guilt tripped, depressed, and working hard at their jobs, I was neglected. Even though I had no friends, was bullied at school, and my parents weren't there for me, I had everything a kid could ask for and then some: I had a PC connected to the Internet without restriction nor supervision.

After knowing that it was possible to get things for free from the Internet due to illegally downloading RPG Maker XP, I stumbled upon Limewire. I learned that I could get music for free and would go on to download the songs of various artists through the power of the Internet. The Internet back then was different; it was a place of raw creation and expression. There was no YouTube, no Facebook, no Reddit. There was MySpace, I didn't sign up. The Internet back then was the wild west and it was perfect. Most people just wanted to share interests and hobbies and chat with others that had similar tastes through message boards. I only lurked and I never told anyone my age. I thought it was a bit weird that a 11 year old had this privilege and I didn't want to ruin it. I learned that I could use Limewire to get Limewire Pro, classic. Back then downloading a single song through the peer-to-peer network could take a couple hours at best and couple days at worse. I thought it was pretty cool that random anonymous people on the Internet were sharing information about how to make life better. Maybe the world ain't so bad. I won't lie, I was a little brat at home, didn't do my homework, and was skipping school. I learned through practice to meditate with music to build resilience.

**Take away: Information is power and if information should be free then sharing information is love.**

I was watching music videos on MTV which some the videos are below. I had these unpaid songs on my iPod Mini thanks to Limewire and some brave souls seeding.

- [Avril Lavigne - Sk8er Boi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIy3n2b7V9k) (You can not escape the Canadian pop-punk.)
- [Simple Plan - I'm Just a Kid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GOR5gvQwDI) (Canadian rock that I could relate to being neglected from my parents and without any friends.)
- [Linkin Park - In The End](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVTXPUF4Oz4) (Suffering through hiding my emotions. In retrospect, it's a real punch to the gut that a guy's message about depression which helped me prevent suicide ended up killing himself.)
- [Jimmy Eat World - The Middle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKsxPW6i3pM) (It was a nice to have a positive message about how things will get better with time even if I didn't believe it. I also really related to being in the "middle" of my parents devorce.)
- [Good Charlotte - Lifestyles of the Rich & Famous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-jC3H_8Dk4) (My parents' financial stress was overflowing onto me; I could not relate to how people with money were complaining about how bad their lives were. I guess not even rich people can escape this hell.)
- [Eminem - Lose Yourself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Yhyp-_hX2s) (Relatable for an 11 year old who was eating spagetti at his mom's house.)
- [Fort Minor - Remember The Name](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDvr08sCPOc) (50% pain was my spirit animal.)
- [Blink-182 - First Date](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVy9Lgpg1m8) (I was starting to crush on girls at school. It was nice that I could finally hypothesize about love. In our small town we also a had water park that looked exactly like the one in the video.)
- [The All-American Rejects - Move Along](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XleOkGsYgO8) (Relatable for an 11 year who had to deal with shit.)
- [The Black Eyed Peas - My Humps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEe_eraFWWs) (This song was incredibly controversial in 2005 by the "mainstream media". It further cemented my rational for freedom from the "thought police"; that pirating music was justified in some twisted way.)
- [Sum 41 - Fat Lip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKsQe31ApMs) (Canadian rock that I could relate to as rebellious edgy pre-teen: "Well I'm a no goodnick lower middle class brat, back packed, and I don't give a shit about nothing". I was also watching less MTV because YouTube was picking up steam in 2006.)
- [Fall Out Boy - Dance, Dance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6MOKXm8x50) (I was watching an uploaded version of this on YouTube in 2006 in repeat. I remember laughing at the scene where the teacher breaks into the bathroom and says "What are you looking at Powerpuff!?" as I watched The Powerpuff Girls on YTV years earlier.)
- [Green Day - American Idiot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee_uujKuJMI) (Thanks to media censorship I was exposed to some jigsaw puzzles of truth from the Internet message boards. "I don't want to be Americian idiot" was a pretty catchy phrase for Canadians whose culture was dominated by United States.)
- ["Weird Al" Yankovic - White & Nerdy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9qYF9DZPdw) (Relatble for a nerd; "I'm nerdy in the extreme, and whiter than sour cream." I remember watching a version of the video on YouTube in late 2006.)

### Early Internet days, GameCube, Nintendo DS, & Wii

The Internet grew on me; I soaked up their collective wisdom like a sponge. They accelerated my learning rate to create video games with RPG Maker XP and script in Ruby. I found a couple folks programming in Ruby who were interested in adding online multiplayer functionality to RPG Maker. This lead me to larger circles of self-taught programmers who were somewhat like me: just troubled teenagers finding a place to call home when their real lifes couldn't provide. Chatting, programming, and playing games with other kids around the world who were going through their own shit made me feel okay about myself. I learned how to program in Visual Basic 6 by following them with Mirage Source in 2004. I reached out and started to use MSN Messenger to play and create online games together. We played online games together like Tibia, Aspereta, Gunbound, Rakian: Choas Force, MapleStory, RuneScape, Defense of Ancients, and Civilization.

Afterschool everyday from 2004 to 2011 I would spend time at my grandparents with my younger cousin waiting for our parents to pick us up. I would leave my GameCube over at my grandparents so we could play Super Smash Bros: Melee together. We also had our own Nintendo DS and played some games together or solo like Metroid Prime Hunters and Pokemon Diamond/Pearl. We also did have some other games for GameCube like Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance, Pokemon XD: Gale of Darkness, Star Fox: Assault, and Shadow the Hedgehog. We would take turns using the PC.

At home and at my grandparents I was growing a strong liking towards the Internet but I would soon start rebelling even harder in real-life due to the devorce. I was skipping school, deleting the phone messages that would left on the answering machine saying I skipped, lying about my homework, etc. I didn't really know about drugs nor was I curious about them as video games filled the void nicely. Over the years at school I acquired a habit of doing my homework at the last possible second because *I could*. As long as my parents saw that I was getting good enough grades they were not going to question or micro-manage me. Switching between parents who hated each other where I was like a ping-pong ball made it pretty easy to fly under the radar undetected. I was either not doing the homework if it had very little consequence, doing the homework late at night, during the morning before class, or even while the teacher is asking for specific answers during a row call. In one class I would even calculate my position in line for row call and do only the couple questions surronding my anticipated position on the spot. I learned to maximize playing hard and minimize working hard. I toke it as a badge of honor and was respected among my peers for it. I was cool enough for a nerd and started to make a handful of friends.

In September 2006 on launch day I bought a Wii with RedSteel using my own money working on an orchard in the summer. This made me a pretty cool kid among my friends when we would would have sleepovers. I would soon later also have Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess and Pokemon Battle Revolution. I left the Wii at my grandparents place.

At home after awhile I got bored of some online games for being too repetitive or grindy and started to question how they work. For example, MapleStory was notorious for being super slow to level up and progress in the game. I did not like how a company was giving players a free game that was basically sucking the lives of people who didn't pay micro-transactions. To me, this wasn't really fair; the only way to win was not to play. At age 12 in early 2006 with too much curiosity for my own good and the power of Internet I learned how hardware and software work at runtime from online boards. I learned the basics of Computer Science through play by changing the memory of the running process and the X86 assembly instructions of the executable. I used Cheat Engine for vaccums that would place items or mobs in one location. I studied the work of smart people on the Internet who just wanted to share information. I grew found of this hacker culture. To me the cheats were permissible grey area because I thought some companies were cheaters of a different kind anyways. It's here where I started to learn about the political game of cat and mouse with people and companies. I learned about how some companies are evil with greed (R.I.P. Westwood Studios) and how some people are also evil with greed. I also learned that some companies and some people are pretty decent or even really awesome. Both sides had their fair share of bad apples; both sides also were right and wrong in their own ways.

After learning how to use Cheat Engine at home I started to break some flash games on PC at my grandparents after school. My younger cousin learned from me and acquired a GameShark for Nintendo DS. We would break our Pokemon Diamond/Pearl to acquire Pokemon which were otherwise pratically unattainable. I would upload a perfect party of all shiny Pokemon to Pokemon Battle Revolution and battled random people online.

**Take away: If it takes a village to raise a child, then the Internet is the new village.**

### PC at home meanwhile Laptops, Flip-phones, & iPods at school

In 2007 I bought myself the first generation iPod Touch with my own money from working in a bakery on an orchard in the summer. I jail broke the iPod Touch a week later.

Between 2007 and 2012 (grade 7 to 12) I toke notice that regardless of a student's interests, skin pigment, clothes, sexual orientation, or parents social economic status, everyone at school had one thing in common. We all hated school. We all intuitively knew the education system was broken. We saw how the system was rigged for a small minority of people with a particular learning style. We saw how history class was not "educating" us with stories like Karl Benz and Nikola Tesla. We heard lies about Christopher Columbus, Isaac Newton, and Thanksgiving. We saw how the "War on Drugs" was bullshit with the D.A.R.E. school program. We saw how America is not really the "land of free, home of the brave", at least not how they told us it was. We saw how the "No Child Left Behind" was actually "No Child Gets Ahead". 

I didn't think the education system was fair, so in spirit of hacker culture I shared knowledge with my peers on how get free information, music, videos, and games using the Internet. I started to make some friends. By now the BitTorrent protocol was the preferred way of pirating things but only the kids who kept up with the underground news knew not to use Limewire anymore. In 2008 my friends at school started to adopt the hacker culture with the help of my influence. The school had WiFi but it was restricted for us kids. My friends taught me how to connect to the Internet at school with a laptop or iPod Touch without a teacher's permission. 

We however knew the risks, we knew that pirating things at school will eventually end badly with us likely to be on the hook. We agreed together we wouldn't pirate at school and only use the internet as if we were a teacher to stay under the radar. We used custom software with a combination of whitelist and blacklist for in/out connections when at school to make it look like our activity were more like teachers. Knowing intuitively that everyone is capable of evil, even myself, I was suspicious that they might cheat. I secretly made rogue software for the PC that would trigger when Limewire or BitTorrent was running when connected to the school network. The program would lock the keyboard and mouse and play a video on screen at full volume. After testing it on myself, I planted it on my friends computers as a prank to remind them the gravity of the situation. The original payload of the video was [Do What You Want, Cause A Pirate Is Free... You Are A Pirate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVXCr6upWUo) inspired by our go to site, The Pirate Bay. In 2010, I relaxed the rules for the trigger and switched the video to [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ). We had a good laugh. They would pass the rogue software along to their other circle of friends to play the role as the prankster for more laughs. Throughout school, we gained the system at every possible turn for our own spirit of playfulness, exploration, and sticking it to the man. Almost everyone I remotely knew at school just wanted to hang out, goof off outside, listen to music, watch movies, or play video games. 

With my cold stare, barely ever saying a word, no fucks given attitude and clothes I would buy with my own money I started to become a cool kid at school with my peers. I had no concept of hate from skin pigment or religion, to me everyone started with equal footing. Of course there were some people hating on each for the most illogical reasons and I questioned why? I thought it was kinda weird and made no sense. I would look up the musical artists I liked and found that they where from all walks of life. I thought does it really matter if someone is white or black? Christian or Muslim? Gay or straight? I knew deep down that love doesn't discriminate and everyone seems to have similar problems regardless of their location or upbringing. Even though I would keep to myself most of the time I would speak my mind when kids were getting bullied. The bullies got suspended and switched schools. By 2011 our graduating class of 2012 had barely any cliques; everyone knew each other by name and we were all friendly enough with each other. After finishing school in 2012 (age 18) we would throw bush parties and drink alcohol on the top of some remote mountains in British Columbia with the vechiles our parents lended or baught for us.

For my last year in high school I knew if I wanted to have any shot for a future I needed to "pull myself up from my bootstraps" to get excellent grades for entry to university. ([Here's my transcript](https://www.dropbox.com/s/9smi19y1oj8j24a/LucasHighschoolTranscript.png?dl=0) where it's night and day between grade 11 and grade 12 even if I bombed my french exam.) This idea that university was the only option would later turn out be a false premise, but at the time it seemed like the only logical choice. Instead of living with my dad for the year I lived with my younger cousin, uncle, and aunt. Self-discipline was particularly hard for me because I had to isolate myself from some people at school I kind of enjoyed being around but were a bad influence. I could no longer play the double card of the cool kid and nerd at the sametime. Since there were no Computer Science classes at high school I would take my spare blocks in grade 12 to learn and practice programming through game dev with C# and XNA. I started to make friends with some teachers because of my work ethic and they would turn a blind eye to my shenanigans from time-to-time like skipping blocks to play Call of Duty and Halo with my friends.

**Takeaway: Being friendly and giving towards others while simultaneously being selfish is a superior strategy in the game of life; making enemies is not worthwhile.**

I joined GitHub on December 11th 2010. I joined Reddit on Janurary 18th 2012 even though I lurked since 2007. I joined Facebook on Saturday, July 14, 2007 at 4:33pm PDT. Throughout 2005 to 2012 I was listening to more happy songs with my friends online and at friends school like:

### University

At university starting in Septemeber 2012 (age 19), I was exposed to all sort of ideas and concepts in Computer Science. Everything was however very intuitive given my background coming in. I learned and used Java which was dead simple given that I already knew Microsoft's Java. In first year I accidentally missed a final exam for Java worth 45% of my final mark and still passed the class because I aced every assignment and test. The problem for me during this time was that first year university was *too easy*.

Since I was 19 I could bootleg alcohol for my peers and started to make some party friends. With a little help from MDMA, alchohol, and some banger party songs, there was a mad as fuck party scenes at UVIC:

- Kid Cudi - Pursuit of Happiness (Steve Aoki Remix)
- Axwell - In My Mind
- Krewella - Alive
- Swedish House Mafia - One (Your Name)
- Alesso vs OneRepublic - If I Lose Myself (Alesso Remix)
- Sebastian Ingrosso & Alesso ft. Ryan Tedder - Calling (Lose My Mind)
- Avicii vs Nicky Romero - I Could Be The One
- Pitbull - Timber ft. Ke$ha

However I didn't like the party scene too much being a introvert nerd. I would spoil these golden years of my life playing video games and wouldn't stretch myself outside of my comfort zone. This lack of work ethic would be my demise. In second year I was skipping and playing League of Legends non-stop 24/7 for weeks and almost flunked out of university completely. Turns out my strategy of "work smarter, play harder" wasn't working out all that well for me anymore.

In 2nd year, for better or worse, I had an accident with my roommates where I ingested some home made cannabis cookies. I didn't know that a small sliver of the cookie was suppose to get you *fucked up* and I ate a whole cookie. I had a serious bad trip because I wasn't setup with the right mood/environment for such a spirtual journey into the nooks and crannies of my soul. My friends didn't know what the hell was going on with me as I flipped from the most introvert quiet nerd you can imagine to the most extrovert outgoing jock. They called over their peers as they didn't believe what was going on. I would suddenly call people out on their bullshit in realtime and then suddenly start apologizing, hugging them, and saying I love them. I would start to have severe paranoia about conspiracy theories one moment such as everyone being a spy out to kill me and how a avertisement on a passing bus was a secret message that "proved" it. The next momement I was down on my knees praying to the light of the chandelier as if I was one of Jesus' Apostles radiating love. My friends called 911 for paramedics under the consideration that perhaps the cookies were laced with some other drug. When the paramedics came to our house one of them was a young male and the other was an attractive young women. They asked: "What was going on here?". I locked deep into her eyes with a straight face and asked "Why do we masterbate?". I was hospitalized for drug abuse. I am very thankful that in Canada drug abuse is considered a health issue and not a criminal issue. Turns out I belong to a small minority of the population that gets psychosis from THC, even in normal amounts. I was "permahigh" after for at least a month were I was non-stop smiling and hugging people.

Without any adults around I needed to learn self-constraint and so I did. I spent all my electives doubleing down on Computer Science and Software Engineering. I learned C, C++, JavaScript, Python, ML, Haskell, Lisp, COBOL, and ARM64 Assembly through various courses. I learned about everything from hardware design, embedded systems, databases, computer graphics, system analysis, computer networks, human-computer interaction, operating systems, and large system software design. When I ran out of Computer Science and Software Engineering courses I dived into philosophy, psychology, and entrepreneurship. I worked hard enough to climb the ladder of academia with solid Bs and As. I didn't care too much about getting perfect grades as I thought it wasn't worth the cost/benefit for the stress. To decompress I started to practice mindfulness meditation. I would go to forest everyday near a small creek and sit in lotus position for increasingly longer periods of time. After a while I started to experience what some would call Spiritual Awakening.

At the beginning of my final year I eventually snapped from stress and I had a mental breakdown. I was hospitalized for showing symptoms of cannabis induced psychosis even though I didn't have any THC. Some would call what happened to me as a "spiritual emergency". I spent some time in the psychiatric hospital while they tried to figure out what the hell was wrong with me since the drug test came back clean. I talked to some other patients in the ward and listened to their stories. I made some friends in there. I learned that everyone has some form of illness whether it was major or minor; nobody was perfectly healthy, not even the nurses and doctors. I was diagnosed with the closest mental illness that matched my history: Bipolar 1.

I returned to my senior year after the psych ward. I was taking medication that spiraled me into a clinical depression. I attempted suicide. I trimmed and sanded my nails and then proceeded to put an industrial garbage bag over my head. I duck tapped it sealed around my neck a couple rounds. After I was hyperventilating for a while I realized I made a mistake. Out of pure force I ripped the bag. In that moment as I was gasping in oxygen I realized something: it doesn't matter how I depressed I get in life, suicide is not the answer.

I switched medications multiple times until I found something reasonable and returned to university. In my final semester I did my undergraduate research thesis. The topic was on the "gap" between the needs of the information technology industry and what universities and institutes of technology were providing to the work force. My findings shocked me as I dug into the topic. I talked to multiple employeers in the industry from the military, blue chips, and startups. I wrote up my research and was reading over it to spot inconsitencies and logical fallacies. After scrutinizing my own research I was convinced that university was a scam for software developers, especially in Canada and United States. I decided to drop out and I never submitted my research. My parents were furious with me. I just couldn't muster the will to cross the finish line of university knowing that it wasn't real. I rather live with the badge of honor of being a drop out then to be the owner of a piece of paper that propagates and upholds a lie in society.

I would go on to spend time learning and practicing health and wellbeing including nutrition, exercise, and meditation. Whether I really have a mental illness or not doesn't bother me; everyone has to be labelled something it seems to be able to play within the rules of society. If being labelled bipolar means I can go on and live a "normal" life so be it. What's ironic is that some extraordinary people in history have been diagnosed with bipolar including Kayne West, Winston Churchill, Frank Sinatra, Ernest Hemingway, Carrie Fisher, Kurt Cobain, Britney Spears, Russell Brand, Mel Gibson, Demi Lovato, Ted Turner, and Brian Wilson. These people despite their troubles of being bipolar, having a "mental illness", were not failures in society. In the contrary, a bit of "madness" helped them grow into the known names they are today. That being said, I wouldn't be shouting from the rooftops that I have a "mental illness". We live in a society where the free-thinking, open-minded people are considered "crazy" and the ignorant, closed-minded people are "normal".

## My vision

In the next dev log I will go over my vision for Katabasis in detail. For now, know that the community of practice around Mirage Source along with the open-source movement has deeply influenced me for this project. I want to capture that spirit of that 11 year old programming for the first time creating a video game. I want to capatalize on the fact that in increasing amount of people think that creating video games, despite being difficult, is cool, fun, and entertaining. I want take advantage of that for a catalyst to teach deeper concepts like Computer Science, Psychology, and Entrepreneurship. Despite never attending MIT, I want to pass on the torch to others about [MIT hacker culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_culture) and it's [hacker ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_ethic#The_hacker_ethics) which rubbed onto me through Internet information boards and programming culture. I want to show how this community's code can potentially save us from ourselves.

As the [MIT hacker equitte goes](https://handbook.mit.edu/hacking):

>1. Be Safe – Your safety, the safety of others, and the safety of anyone you hack should never be compromised.
>2. Be Subtle – Leave no evidence that you were ever there.
>3. Leave things as you found them – or better.
>4. If you find something broken call F-IXIT.
>5. Leave no damage.
>6. Do not steal anything.
>7. Brute force is the last resort of the incompetent.
>8. Do not hack while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.
>9. Do not drop things off (a building) without a ground crew.
>10. Do not hack alone.
>11. Above all exercise some common sense.
