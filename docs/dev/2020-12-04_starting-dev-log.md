# 2020-12-04: Starting a development log

### Written by [@lithiumtoast](https://github.com/lithiumtoast) on Friday, December 4th, 2020

I'm starting a development log which hopefully will help people learn about the development of Katabasis.

### Project Rename

The project got renamed from "Ankura" to "Katabasis" because the name Ankura was already [taken by an organization](https://github.com/ARPC). The name "Katabasis" as of 2020-12-04 is not taken by any "significant" project in active development on GitHub yet. The name itself is of greek origin: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katabasis. Back when I was working with Visual Basic 6 with [Mirage Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5JaByOWNcg) in my childhood, a lot of the spinoff projects were named based on the greek underworld including residents and geography such as the [Elysium Engine](https://sourceforge.net/projects/elysium/files/Elysium%20Engine/). The name "katabasis" is a tribute to my childhood.

### Improving the Documentation

I firmly believe that I should improve the documentation of the project before I continue with the software development. Starting a dev log is part of that idea. This also includes writing down my thoughts on C# for game development outlined in the architecture section and writing down some thoughts on the existing samples.

### Next Time

Once I think the documentation is satisfactory I will be continuing adding more samples of how to use Katabasis. These samples are important because I'm using them as a form of testing to ensure that the fork of FNA is working correctly.
