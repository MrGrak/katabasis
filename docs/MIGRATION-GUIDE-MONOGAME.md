# Mirgration Guide for MonoGame Developers

> :notebook: The following guide is for the latest version of Katabasis [*released* version](https://github.com/craftworkgames/Katabasis/tags) and the latest version of MonoGame.

Since Katabasis is a fork of FNA, the differences between Katabasis and MonoGame are the same as the differences between MonoGame and FNA, and then FNA to Katabasis. It's recommended you migrate to FNA as the first step and then follow the FNA migration guide: [MIGRATION-GUIDE-FNA.md](MIGRATION-GUIDE-FNA.md).

For the differences between MonoGame and FNA, see the following links:
